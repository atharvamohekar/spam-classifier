# Project Details

## Problem Statement
Create a classifier to detect a particular email as SPAM or HAM(Not spam). We'll utilize supervised learning techniques like Baye's Classifier or Random Forest to do the same.

## Step to follow

### 1. Importing Data 
Use pandas to import the data

### 2. Cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Perform initial cleaning and conduct EDA
Look into Distribution, Email lengths, relationships

### 3. Data Preprocessing (NLP Part)
Use NLTK to do the follwing preprocesing techniques - Tokenization, Stemming, stop words, word cloud

### 4. Data Preprocessing (ML Part)
Encoding (Vectorization)

### 5. Model Building
Create decision tree base model. Build over it use Bayes Classfier & Random Forest Classifier

### 6. Model Testing & Metrics
Use cross validation to evaluate the model. Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score

### 7. Export Model
Use pickel to export the model

We'll try to follow the following tutorial
